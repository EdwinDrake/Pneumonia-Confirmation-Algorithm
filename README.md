# Pneumonia-Confirmation-Algorithm
This repository contains a Quarto-based analysis for detecting pneumonia from X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project leverages the chest X-ray pneumonia dataset and provides a detailed report of the modelâ€™s performance.
## Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation.
- CNN model training and evaluation.
- Visualizations of learning curves and sample predictions.
- Comprehensive HTML report generated using Quarto.

## Project Structure
- **`Pneumonia-Confirmation-Algorithm.qmd`**: Quarto script containing the analysis.
- **`Pneumonia-Confirmation-Algorithm.html`**: Rendered report.
- **`data/`**: Raw and processed datasets.The dataset used in this project is too large to host directly on GitHub. You can download it from the following link:
